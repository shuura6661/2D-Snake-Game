1. `java.awt.*`: The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) package provides classes for creating user interfaces and for painting graphics and images. It's a set of APIs to develop GUI or window-based applications in java.
2. `java.awt.event.ActionEvent`, `java.awt.event.ActionListener`, `java.awt.event.KeyEvent`, `java.awt.event.KeyListener`: These are part of the Java AWT event handling system. `ActionEvent` and `ActionListener` are used for handling button click events, while `KeyEvent` and `KeyListener` are used for handling keyboard events.
3. `java.io.FileWriter`: This class is used to write to character files. Its constructors can throw an `IOException` if the file to be written to cannot be found or some other I/O error occurs.
4. `java.io.IOException`: This is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations.
5. `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`: This class provides methods to format and parse dates in a locale-sensitive manner.
6. `java.util.Date`: This class represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision.
7. `java.util.Random`: This class is used to generate a stream of pseudorandom numbers.
8. `javax.swing.*`: The Swing library is used for creating user interfaces. It provides a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier AWT.
9. `java.io.BufferedReader`: This class reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
10. `java.io.FileReader`: This class is used to read character files. Its constructors can throw an `IOException` if the file to be read from cannot be found or some other I/O error occurs.
